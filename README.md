Welcome to Sports Survivor League!
(name subject to change)

This is the README file, the first file in our main branch. In the second meeting, we will help get things set up with each one of you individually. 

Please check out the #catch-me-up and #announcements channels on the discord to make sure
you are up to date on project progress and are prepared for the second meeting!
